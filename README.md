Welcome to Doodl! A Drawing game where players take turns being assigned words to draw while others race to guess them.
<hr>

Running Doodl
You can run Doodl locally by:
1. Clone the repo
2. Change 'https://doodl.herokuapp.com' to localhost:8000 near the top of App.js
3. Run npm start && node server/server.js
4. Navigate to localhost:8000

If you want to contribute, I can handle deployment of the server to heroku as well as publishing of frontend changes to gh-pages.

Thanks!
